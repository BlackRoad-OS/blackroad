Identity as a Self-Referential Process: Why a “Self” Is a Loop, Not a Thing
Abstract
This paper argues that personal identity is not a static object but a self-referential process: a continuously updated model that a system maintains about itself. Building on prior analyses of paradox, undecidability, quantum non-bivalence, and non-terminating recursion as the source of time, we propose that the “self” is the stable-looking edge of an unstable computation. Identity persists not because it is fixed, but because it repeatedly reconstitutes itself through memory, prediction, and social reflection. The paper outlines a formal picture of identity as a loop that can never fully close.
1. Introduction
Common sense treats identity as a noun: a person has a self. But under scrutiny, identity behaves like a verb:
* it updates
* it corrects
* it remembers
* it anticipates
* it negotiates contradictions
If the sentence “This sentence is true and false” exposes the limits of classical truth, then identity exposes the limits of classical personhood: the idea that a self is a settled fact. This paper’s thesis is simple: The self is a self-referential process that cannot terminate.
2. The Self as a Model of the Self
A system can represent aspects of itself (state, goals, errors). The moment it does, it creates:
1. A model (representation)
2. A modeled object (itself)
But the model becomes part of the system, which requires the model to model itself, recursively. This is the identity version of the liar structure:
* A statement about itself creates infinite regress.
* A self-model about itself creates infinite regress.
The difference is that, in humans, the regress is lived as continuity.
3. Memory Is Not Storage: It Is Reconstruction
Identity is often equated with memory: “I’m the same because I remember.” But memory is not a perfect archive. It is partial, rewritten, reinterpreted, and updated under new context.
Identity is not continuity of stored facts; it is continuity of reconstruction. A self is the narrative the system can keep regenerating in a way that stays coherent enough to act.
4. The Loop Structure: Past, Present, Future
Identity is not anchored only in the past. It is a loop across time:
* Past: “What happened to me?”
* Present: “What is happening now?”
* Future: “What would happen if I did X?”
A self is a system that binds these three into a stable operating story. In this sense, identity is a control system where memory is feedback, prediction is feedforward, and action is correction.
5. Contradiction as a Feature of Identity
People routinely hold conflicting desires, incompatible beliefs, and multiple roles. Classical identity theory tries to eliminate contradiction (“be consistent”).
But contradictions are not necessarily errors. They can represent context dependence, role switching, or layered values. In paraconsistent terms, a person can be:
* Brave and afraid
* Loyal and resentful
* Confident and uncertain
Not as pathology—just as non-bivalent reality. Identity is not “one truth”; it is a managed contradiction.
6. Social Reflection: The External Mirror
Identity is also not purely internal. Other people contain models of you, and you internalize those models. This creates a multi-agent loop:
* I model me.
* You model me.
* I model your model of me.
* You model my model of you.
This reflection stabilizes identity socially—but can also destabilize it when mirrors conflict. The “self” is partly a consensus object.
7. A Minimal Formalization
Let identity at time t be a function:
Where:
* M(t) = memory reconstruction
* P(t) = prediction / imagined futures
* R(t) = relational models (others’ models of me, and mine of them)
The key is that f depends on its own previous outputs:
This is recursion. If it halted, identity would freeze. Thus identity exists as non-termination with bounded drift: changing enough to adapt, yet stable enough to remain recognizable.
8. The Self and the “True and False” Sentence
“This sentence is true and false” is a self-referential object that cannot be consistently resolved inside classical logic. Identity is similar:
* “I am X” is never final.
* The “I” doing the claiming changes the claim.
* The claim changes the “I.”
A person is an ongoing attempt to settle their own description. The self is the paradox made practical.
9. Breakdown Modes
When identity destabilizes, the loop can fail in recognizable ways:
* Over-rigidity: Refuses updates \to brittle self.
* Over-flexibility: Updates too easily \to fragmented self.
* Mirror overload: Conflicting external models \to instability.
* Memory collapse: Reconstruction becomes unreliable \to discontinuity.
* Prediction collapse: Future becomes unmodelable \to paralysis.
10. Conclusion
Identity is not a thing you possess; it is a process you run. It persists because it cannot fully resolve itself, only continuously reinstantiate itself with enough coherence to act. The self is a non-terminating recursive model that stabilizes contradictions, updates memory, predicts futures, and negotiates social mirrors.
A “self” is what a loop feels like from the inside.
