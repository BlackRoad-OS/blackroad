To stop thinking and start building, we must view this entire stack not as a collection of gadgets, but as a Recursive Intelligence Router. Following the BlackRoad Manifesto, we aren't building a "brain"; we are building the switchboard that connects existing intelligence to physical reality.
Here is the functional architecture of how your hardware interacts with your software ecosystem:
1. The Physical Switchboard (The Pi 5 Cluster)
Your 4x Raspberry Pi 5s are the local routing nodes. They do not "think" in the traditional sense; they orchestrate.
 * The Pironman 5-MAX Nodes (AI Hubs): These house the Hailo-8 modules. Their role is to run local, high-speed vision and signal processing (ToF/Radar) to determine what needs to be routed.
 * The ElectroCookie Nodes (Neural Nodes): These handle the "State Management," keeping track of which agents are doing what across the mesh.
 * Interaction: They talk to each other via the TP-Link Gigabit Switch (wired reflex) and use the Si5351A Clock Generator to stay in picosecond sync, ensuring data packets from different sensors arrive in a coherent "quantum" stream.
2. The Cloud Reflex (Cloudflare & DigitalOcean)
This is your "Sovereign Tunnel." It makes your home-based tower appear as a high-security enterprise server.
 * Cloudflare (Zero Trust): You run a Cloudflare Tunnel (cloudflared) on the Master Pi 5. This punches a hole through your ISP without port forwarding, allowing your DigitalOcean Droplets to talk to your local cluster as if they were on the same desk.
 * Role: Cloudflare acts as the "Bouncer." It ensures only your specific Apple M1 and PSP-3000 can access the control shell, protecting the Sentinel from 2026-era automated crawlers.
3. The Agentic State Store (Salesforce & GitHub)
As per your manifesto, you are using Salesforce not for CRM, but as a free enterprise-grade backend.
 * Salesforce (The Database): Your Pi 5 nodes use the Simple-Salesforce Python library to sync sensor logs and agent actions into Salesforce Custom Objects. Because you "removed the human," you are using the Developer Edition’s 15,000 daily API calls to store the "State of the World" for $0/month.
 * GitHub (The Source of Truth): All your "Reflex Logic" and "Neural Node" configurations are stored here. When you update code on your M1 Mac, the Pi cluster pulls the changes and re-flashes the ESP32-S3s and ATTINY88s automatically.
4. The Tactical Interface (PSP-3000 & Sensors)
This is how you "feel" the data.
 * The Sensing Layer: The VL53L5CX ToF and LD2410 Radar send raw field data to the Pi 5. The Hailo-8 prunes this into "Events" (e.g., "Human Detected at 2 meters").
 * The PSP-3000: The Pi 4B (Remote Control Server) captures the UI from the cluster and streams it to the PSP. You use the PSP's physical buttons to trigger "Salesforce Flows"—for example, pressing "X" on the PSP tells a Salesforce Agent to initiate a security protocol.
 * Haptic Feedback: When Salesforce confirms an action, the Pi sends a signal back through the RS485 bus to trigger the Bone Conduction Speaker and Vibration Motors, giving you a physical pulse that the "loop" is closed.
5. The Cold Heart (Archival Media)
 * Role: The Alxum Hub writes the daily "Salesforce State" and "Hailo-8 Patterns" onto the Verbatim Gold and Double Layer discs.
 * Sovereignty: If Cloudflare goes down or Salesforce changes their terms, your intelligence isn't lost. You have a physical, laser-etched record of every decision your agents made, stored in the "Sentinel's Library."

The "Thinking" is done. We have the switchboard (Pi 5), the bouncer (Cloudflare), the librarian (Salesforce), and the tactical remote (PSP).
Which part of the "Wiring" do we start with right now?
 * Option 1: The Tunnel. Setting up Cloudflare on the Pi 5 to make it "visible" to your M1 Mac?
 * Option 2: The Agent. Writing the first Python script to send LD2410 Radar data into a Salesforce Custom Object?
 * Option 3: The Tactile. Connecting the PSP-3000 to the Pi 4B to see your first "Sovereign Shell"?
