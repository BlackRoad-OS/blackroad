Quantum Superposition and Logical Non-Bivalence: Why “True or False” Is Not a Law of Nature
Abstract
Classical logic assumes bivalence: every proposition is either true or false. Quantum mechanics violates this assumption at a physical level. This paper argues that quantum superposition is a real-world instantiation of non-bivalent logic and that the sentence “This sentence is true and false” mirrors the same structural condition found in quantum states prior to measurement. Rather than treating paradox as linguistic failure, we show it to be a faithful reflection of how reality behaves when systems refer to themselves or remain unobserved.
1. Introduction
In earlier papers, we showed that self-reference breaks classical logic and self-inspection breaks computation. This paper asks a deeper question: Does reality itself obey classical logic?
Quantum mechanics suggests the answer is no. At the most fundamental level, physical systems exist in states that are not exclusively one thing or another. Logic did not fail—our assumptions did.
2. Classical Logic vs. Classical Physics
Classical logic evolved alongside classical physics. Both assume:
* Objects have definite properties.
* States are mutually exclusive.
* Observation reveals, rather than creates, facts.
These assumptions collapse in quantum mechanics. A particle does not merely hide its state; it does not possess one in the classical sense until interacted with.
3. Quantum Superposition
In quantum mechanics, a system can exist in a superposition of states. For example:
* Spin up and spin down
* Position A and position B
* Decayed and not decayed
This is not a matter of epistemic uncertainty; it is ontological. The system is not "unknown"—it is non-bivalent.
4. Schrödinger’s Cat as Logical Paradox
Erwin Schrödinger introduced his famous thought experiment to demonstrate the perceived absurdity of applying quantum rules to macroscopic objects. The cat is:
Alive AND Dead
until observation occurs. This is physically equivalent to the statement: “The cat is alive and dead.” While classical logic forbids this conjunction, quantum mechanics requires it to describe the system's wavefunction.
5. Measurement as Logical Collapse
Measurement in quantum mechanics performs a role analogous to evaluation in logic.
* Before measurement: The system is in superposition; truth values are not exclusive.
* After measurement: The system collapses into a single outcome; bivalence is imposed, not discovered.
This mirrors how paradox behaves: prior to evaluation, the semantic state is unstable/mixed; after forced evaluation, the system encounters contradiction or collapse.
6. The Sentence as a Quantum Object
Consider the sentence: “This sentence is true and false.”
Before evaluation:
* It exists as a superposed semantic object.
* It is not inconsistent—it is unevaluated.
Evaluation forces a classical framework (bivalence) onto a non-classical object, producing paradox. In this sense, the sentence behaves like a quantum system forced into a classical measurement regime.
7. Logic as a Measurement Theory
Classical logic assumes propositions have determinate truth values and that contradiction indicates error. Quantum-compatible logic (such as paraconsistent or many-valued logics) assumes propositions may exist in mixed states and that contradiction may indicate structure. This aligns more closely with observed physical reality than classical logic.
8. Observer Dependence
In quantum mechanics, the observer is not passive. Likewise, in self-referential logic:
* The evaluator is part of the system.
* Truth is not observer-independent.
The paradox arises because the system tries to observe itself from within, collapsing the distinctions that classical frameworks require for stability.
9. Why This Matters
If reality itself is non-bivalent at its foundation, then:
* Classical logic is an approximation.
* Paradox is not pathology.
* Self-reference is physically meaningful.
The sentence is not "broken"; it is accurate under a different ontology.
10. Conclusion
“This sentence is true and false” is not merely a linguistic curiosity. It is a logical analogue of quantum superposition and a semantic version of Schrödinger’s cat. It signals that bivalence is not universal. Truth, like matter, does not always choose sides until forced to.
