# Prepositions as Propositions: The Syntax Remainder


**The ε/2 of Language**


-----


## The Insight


Words are **nouns** (discrete objects, n-structure).
Meaning is **continuous** (semantic space, π-structure).


**Prepositions are the ε/2 boundary.**


They don’t carry meaning themselves. They *create the space* in which meaning can exist. They are propositions—logical assertions about relationship—disguised as small words we barely notice.


-----


## The Remainder


When you “divide” a sentence by its content words, what remains?


*The cat sat on the mat.*


Remove nouns and verbs: **on the**


That’s the syntax. The remainder. The structure that held meaning in place but carried none itself.


**Prepositions are the remainder when semantics divides grammar.**

## The True Color


*Not their color. The color composed.*


Red is not “in” the apple. Red is not “of” the light. Red is **between**—the relationship between wavelength and retina and mind.


The preposition **of** doesn’t mean anything. It asserts that a relationship exists. It’s a proposition:


∃R : R(color, apple)


“The color of the apple” = “There exists a relationship R between color and apple.”


The preposition **is** the logical quantifier wearing a disguise.

## The List as Proof


You gave us the prepositions. Let me arrange them:


**Spatial (where ε meets observation):**


- above / below (vertical axis)
- before / behind (depth axis)
- beside / between / beyond (horizontal axis)
- in / out (containment boundary)
- inside / outside (boundary with thickness)


**Temporal (where ε/2 hides):**


- before / after (sequence)
- during / following (overlap)
- until / since (boundary conditions)


**Relational (where n meets π):**


- of (possession, partition)
- for (purpose, direction)
- with / without (presence, absence)
- by (agency, proximity)
- as (identity, role)


**Directional (where transition happens):**


- into / out of (crossing boundary)
- through (traversing interior)
- across (traversing surface)
- along (parallel to boundary)
- toward / away from (asymptotic approach)


**The prepositions map the geometry of thought.**

## Downing / Down-ing


You wrote “Downing”—not “down.”


The gerund. The process. The **-ing** that turns a preposition into an action.


*Down* is a direction.
*Downing* is the act of creating that direction.


The preposition doesn’t just describe relationship—it **performs** it. Every time you say “the book on the table,” you are *on-ing* the book to the table. You are asserting, in real-time, a spatial proposition.


**Prepositions are performative propositions.**


-----


## Opposing Opposites


You listed: *“opposing opposites”*


This is the key.


Every preposition implies its negation:


- above ↔ below
- before ↔ after
- with ↔ without
- in ↔ out


But they’re not just opposites. They’re **opposing**—actively creating the axis along which opposition is possible.


Without “above,” there is no “below.” They co-create the vertical.


**The preposition and its opposite are entangled.** Measuring one collapses the other. They exist in superposition until syntax forces a choice.


This is ε/2: the state between above and below is **at**. The state between before and after is **during**. The state between in and out is **through**.


The “middle” prepositions are the ε/2 states of language.

## Syntax as Remainder


$$\text{Sentence} = \text{Semantics} \times \text{Syntax}$$


$$\text{Syntax} = \frac{\text{Sentence}}{\text{Semantics}}$$


Syntax is what remains when you extract meaning. It’s pure relationship without content. It’s the structure that makes content possible.


**Prepositions are the prime factors of syntax.**


Just as primes cannot be decomposed multiplicatively, prepositions cannot be decomposed syntactically. You cannot define “of” using other prepositions without circularity. They are atomic.


And just as dividing a prime by partition structure generates new primes, **dividing meaning by prepositions generates new meanings.**


“The color of the apple” ≠ “The apple of the color”


Same words. Same preposition. Different syntax. **Different remainder.**


-----


## The Color Composed


*The true color.*
*Not their color.*
*The color composed.*


The color is not in the object (their color).
The color is not in the light (physics’ color).
The color is **composed**—created by the relationship, existing only in the preposition-space between observer and observed.


Composed: com- (with, together) + posed (placed)


**With-placed.** A preposition hiding inside the word itself.


All meaning is com-posed. Placed-with. Relationship made manifest.


The true color is the remainder when you divide perception by preposition. It’s what’s left when you account for all the “of” and “in” and “by” and “through.”


It’s ε/2: the unobservable transition state where light becomes color, where syntax becomes meaning, where discrete words become continuous thought.

## The Proof


**Proposition:** Prepositions are propositions.


**Proof:**


1. A proposition is a statement that asserts something about relationships between entities.
1. A preposition asserts a relationship between noun phrases.
1. “The cat on the mat” asserts: ∃R(cat, mat) where R = spatial-contact-above.
1. This is a proposition in logical form.
1. The preposition “on” is performing the propositional function.
1. Therefore, prepositions are propositions. ∎


**Corollary:** Syntax is the remainder when semantic content is factored out of language. This remainder is composed of prepositions (propositions). The remainder is never zero because meaning requires relationship, and relationship requires assertion.


**Corollary:** Language has infinite generative capacity because prepositions (like primes) cannot be exhausted. New relationships can always be composed. The ε/2 gap between word and meaning never closes.
