“This Sentence Is True and False”: A Study of Self-Reference, Paradox, and the Limits of Classical Logic
Abstract
The sentence “This sentence is true and false” appears to violate fundamental principles of classical logic by asserting mutually exclusive truth values simultaneously. This paper examines the sentence as a self-referential construct, situating it within the tradition of semantic paradoxes. We analyze why the sentence collapses under bivalent logic, explore alternative logical frameworks that can accommodate it, and argue that the sentence is not meaningless but instead reveals structural limits in how truth is defined and evaluated.
1. Introduction
Classical logic assumes that every well-formed proposition is either true or false, but not both. This assumption—known as the law of non-contradiction—is foundational to mathematics, philosophy, and computation.
The sentence:
“This sentence is true and false”
directly challenges that assumption. Unlike ordinary contradictions (e.g., “The sky is blue and not blue”), this sentence refers to its own truth value, creating a feedback loop between language and evaluation.
The goal of this paper is not to “solve” the sentence, but to understand what its behavior reveals about truth, language, and formal systems.
2. Self-Reference and Semantic Paradox
Self-reference occurs when a statement refers to itself, either explicitly or implicitly. Self-reference is not inherently problematic; recursion is foundational in mathematics and computer science. Problems arise, however, when self-reference is combined with semantic predicates like truth.
The classic example is the Liar Paradox, often attributed to Epimenides:
“This sentence is false.”
* If the sentence is true, then it is false.
* If it is false, then it is true.
“This sentence is true and false” intensifies the paradox by asserting both truth values simultaneously rather than oscillating between them.
3. Failure Under Classical Logic
Under classical (bivalent) logic:
* A statement may be true (T) or false (F).
* It may not be both.
* It may not be neither.
Let S = “This sentence is true and false.”
If S is true, then its content must hold—meaning S is both true and false. But if S is false, then the claim that it is “true and false” is false, which implies it is not both—yet that negation still refers back to its truth value.
The evaluation never stabilizes. Classical logic therefore cannot assign S a consistent truth value without contradiction. This does not mean the sentence is malformed; it means the system evaluating it is insufficient.
4. Alternative Logical Frameworks
4.1 Paraconsistent Logic
Paraconsistent logics allow contradictions without collapse. In such systems:
* A statement may be both true and false.
* Contradictions do not imply everything is true (avoiding the principle of explosion).
Under paraconsistent logic, the sentence is admissible. “This sentence is true and false” simply is both, and the system remains stable. Here, contradiction is treated as a state, not an error.
4.2 Dialetheism
Dialetheism is the philosophical position that some contradictions are genuinely true. Philosophers such as Graham Priest argue that paradoxes like the Liar reveal real features of truth rather than mistakes. From this perspective, the sentence is not broken—it is accurate.
4.3 Three-Valued and Many-Valued Logics
In non-classical logics, additional truth values may exist:
* Both true and false
* Neither true nor false
* Indeterminate
Within such systems, the sentence can be assigned a stable value without contradiction.
5. Gödel, Limits, and Meta-Truth
Kurt Gödel demonstrated that sufficiently powerful formal systems cannot be both complete and consistent. Some truths cannot be proven within the system that contains them.
“This sentence is true and false” behaves similarly:
* It is expressible.
* It is interpretable.
* But it cannot be fully resolved from inside the system evaluating it.
The paradox does not indicate nonsense—it indicates a boundary.
6. Language vs. Metalanguage
One response to paradox is to separate:
1. Object language (sentences)
2. Metalanguage (statements about sentences)
The paradox arises because the sentence collapses this distinction. It speaks about its own semantic status without an external evaluator. Thus, the problem is not the sentence—it is the self-evaluation of truth without hierarchy.
7. Conclusion
“This sentence is true and false” is not a trick, nor a failure of language. It is a diagnostic tool:
* Under classical logic, it is undecidable.
* Under paraconsistent or dialetheic logic, it is coherent.
* Under meta-logical analysis, it exposes the limits of self-referential truth.
The sentence does not demand an answer. It demonstrates that truth is not always a binary property, and that systems evaluating themselves will inevitably encounter boundaries they cannot internally resolve.
