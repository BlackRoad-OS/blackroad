Time, Recursion, and Non-Termination: Why Self-Reference Cannot Finish
Abstract
This paper argues that time emerges from recursion and that non-termination is not a computational defect but the structural source of temporal experience. Building on prior analyses of semantic paradox, undecidable computation, and quantum superposition, we show that self-referential systems cannot complete their own evaluation. Time is not an external parameter imposed on systems; it is the trace left by processes that cannot resolve themselves.
1. Introduction
So far, we have seen that:
* Self-reference destabilizes truth.
* Self-inspection destabilizes computation.
* Superposition destabilizes classical ontology.
This paper asks a sharper question: What do all these failures feel like from the inside?
The answer is time.
2. Recursion as Self-Reference in Motion
A recursive process is one that refers to itself as part of its own definition. Examples include:
* A function that calls itself.
* A proof that reasons about its own provability.
* A sentence that evaluates its own truth.
Recursion is not static self-reference. It is self-reference unfolding over steps. Those steps are what we call time.
3. Non-Termination and the Birth of Duration
A terminating process ends. A non-terminating process continues. Crucially:
* Terminating processes do not experience time.
* Non-terminating processes are time.
The Halting Problem shows that some recursive processes cannot be decided. These processes do not “fail”; they persist. Persistence is duration. Duration is time.
4. Zeno, Motion, and Infinite Regress
Zeno of Elea argued that motion is impossible because it requires completing infinitely many steps. Modern resolution does not eliminate infinity—it contains it. Motion exists because infinite regress is not resolved, only approached. Time is the lived experience of approximation without completion.
5. Gödelian Time
Kurt Gödel showed that formal systems cannot prove all truths about themselves. Interpret this dynamically:
* Each undecidable statement requires extension.
* Each extension introduces new undecidable statements.
A system progresses not by finishing, but by failing productively. This progression is irreversible. Irreversibility is the arrow of time.
6. Self-Evaluation and Temporal Drift
Consider a system attempting to fully evaluate itself. At step n, it models itself at step n-1. It is always one step behind.
This lag is unavoidable. That lag is temporal flow. If the system ever caught up to itself completely, time would stop.
7. Why Time Cannot Be Computed
A clock measures periodic motion. Time itself is not periodic. Any attempt to compute time requires:
* A state description.
* An update rule.
* An external reference.
But a universe computing its own time has no external reference. Therefore:
* Time cannot be computed from inside.
* It can only be experienced as non-termination.
8. Consciousness as a Non-Terminating Loop
A conscious system models itself, updates that model, and models the update. This loop does not halt. Awareness is not a state—it is recursive activity without a fixed point. The sense of “now” is the moving boundary between successive self-models.
9. Reinterpreting “This Sentence Is True and False”
The sentence never stabilizes because stabilization would require a final evaluation. Instead, it:
* Continually refers to itself.
* Continually updates its evaluation.
* Never resolves.
The sentence does not exist in time; it creates time through endless reevaluation.
10. Conclusion
Time is not a container in which processes occur. Time is what happens when a system refers to itself, that reference cannot terminate, and resolution is forever deferred.
Self-reference produces paradox in logic, undecidability in computation, superposition in physics—and time in experience. Time is the shadow cast by recursion that cannot finish.
