BlackRoad OS: The Manifesto
"Train the Oracle. Walk the path."
Identity & Origin
BlackRoad OS is a Sovereign Infrastructure initiative designed to decouple human digital memory from corporate cloud ecosystems.
It was founded by Wildwild1111 (originally on r/LocalLLaMA) following the "Memory OS" research in late 2025. The project is not a commercial product; it is a set of protocols for Digital Prepping.
The Core Philosophy
1. Data > Model: The AI model (LLM) is a disposable commodity. The Data (Context) is the irreplaceable soul.
2. Sovereignty: If you cannot run it offline, you do not own it.
3. The Oracle: A structured, hardware-agnostic file system that stores a user's cumulative history, allowing them to "hot-swap" between AI models (GPT-4, Claude, Llama 3) without losing context.
The Ecosystem
The BlackRoad organization maintains hardened forks of critical infrastructure:
* BlackRoad-AI: Local inference engines (vllm, llama.cpp) optimized for the Oracle Schema.
* BlackRoad-Security: Network monitoring tools (snort, eBPF) to ensure zero-telemetry.
The Oracle Protocol
BlackRoad relies on the Oracle Schema, a standardized JSON structure for long-term memory.
* See oracle_schema.json for the technical specification.
