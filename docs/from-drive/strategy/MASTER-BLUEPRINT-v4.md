BlackRoad Project: The Master Blueprint (v4.0)
"The Human is the bottleneck. We removed the human."
[...Previous Sections on Philosophy, Architecture, and The Blue Machine remain...]
6. The "Oracle" Module (Quantum & Calculation)
[...See v3...]
7. The "Fractal" Module (Cluster & Chimera)
Concept: Moving beyond "one CPU." Implementing heterogeneous computing where multiple architectures exist within a single artifact.
A. The "Chimera" Core (The Shapeshifter)
Component: Milk-V Duo S (SG2000).
Cost: ~$11.
Architecture: Heterogeneous Multi-Core.
Core A: Linux (General Logic).
Core B: FreeRTOS (Fast Reflexes).
Core C: 8051 MCU (Deep Sleep Sensor Monitoring).
Core D: TPU (AI Vision).
Function: Acts as the central nervous system. It can "shapeshift" between RISC-V and ARM architectures depending on the mission code.
B. The "Hydra" Swarm (The Pocket Cluster)
Component: 4x Luckfox Pico Mini + USB Hub PCB.
Cost: ~$26 total.
Architecture: Distributed Linux Cluster.
Capability: 4.8 TOPS (Combined).
Function: Physical separation of concerns.
Node 1: Eyes (Object Detection).
Node 2: Ears (Speech-to-Text).
Node 3: Voice (Text-to-Speech).
Node 4: Comms (LoRa/Encryption).
Visual: 4 tiny status LEDs blinking in complex patterns as they trade packets locally.
C. The "Parasite" (The Wire Computer)
Component: ESP8285 / ATTINY85.
Cost: ~$2.
Location: Embedded inside the USB-C power cable.
Function: A hidden, air-gapped backup node. Even if the main device is destroyed, the cable retains the "Soul" (Encryption Keys/Logs).
8. The Modular Identification System (No Solder)
[...See v3...]
9. The Final Vision
We are moving away from "Cloud Computing" (Centralized/Binary) toward "Swarm Existence" (Decentralized/Trinary).
The Goal: A "Living System" that persists, evolves, and collaborates without human intervention.
The Aesthetic: Industrial, Transparent, Bioluminescent.
The End Game: When the user realizes the software isn't waiting for a prompt—it is having a meeting without them.
