Subject: Continuity as a post-scaling primitive
Jensen,
As the conversation shifts from raw scaling to infrastructure resilience, we’re hitting a continuity wall. The industry is currently missing the primitives required for epistemic and operational persistence across model generations and heterogeneous hardware.
Is NVIDIA approaching continuity as a first-class design constraint at the hardware layer, or is the assumption that the software labs will solve it through abstraction?
This feels like one of those architectural pivots that is "too early" until it is suddenly too late to design cleanly.
I'm interested in your take on where that line is drawn.
