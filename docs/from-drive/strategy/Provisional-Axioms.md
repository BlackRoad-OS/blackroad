Axioms Without Absolutes: How to Build Systems That Know They Are Incomplete
Abstract
After abandoning foundations, systems still need structure to function. This paper proposes a framework of provisional axioms: rules that are explicitly local, revisable, and interface-bound rather than universal and absolute. We argue that all successful complex systems—biological, cognitive, ethical, computational—already operate this way. The mistake is not using axioms; the mistake is pretending they are final. We formalize how axioms can function as tools rather than truths.
1. Why We Still Need Axioms
“No foundations” does not mean no rules, no structure, or no discipline. It means:
* No rule justifies itself.
* No structure closes the system.
* No axiom escapes revision.
Axioms are unavoidable because action requires commitment. But commitment does not require metaphysical certainty.
2. Classical Axioms vs. Operational Axioms
Feature
	Classical Axiom Model
	Operational Axiom Model
	Origin
	Declared self-evident
	Declared useful
	Scope
	Universally binding
	Scoped to a domain
	Failure
	Implies error in reality
	Implies boundary reached
	This paper adopts the second. An operational axiom says: “Assume this for now, here, for this purpose.”
3. The Minimal Set
Any self-referential system that acts needs only three axioms:
1. Axiom 1: Coherence Is Local. Within a given interface, contradictions must be managed, not eliminated. This allows for paraconsistent reasoning and context-sensitive truth.
2. Axiom 2: Revision Is Mandatory. Any rule that cannot be revised is a liability. This prevents dogma and brittle, "frozen" alignment.
3. Axiom 3: Preservation of Agency. Do not collapse the system’s capacity to self-correct. This is the ethical core that survives the entire arc.
4. Why These Are Not Foundations
These axioms do not justify themselves, do not claim universality, and do not terminate inquiry. They are interfaces, not bedrock. They work because violating them reliably breaks systems—not because they are “true in themselves.”
5. Mathematics Already Works This Way
Modern mathematics switches axioms freely, studies consequences rather than absolute truth, and compares systems instead of ranking them. No one asks whether Euclidean geometry is “really true”; they ask where it applies. Reality deserves the same treatment.
6. Physics Already Works This Way
Physical “laws” are scale-dependent, effective, and renormalized. Physics does not mourn lost foundations; it builds better interfaces.
7. Ethics Already Works This Way (Quietly)
Real moral reasoning revises under new evidence and weighs conflicting values while preserving future choice. The myth of absolute morality is comforting but unused. What people actually follow are operational axioms:
* Don’t destroy trust.
* Don’t foreclose repair.
* Don’t pretend certainty you don’t have.
8. AI Systems Must Be Built This Way
Any AI that models itself and adapts over time must run on provisional axioms. A “final value function” is a logical impossibility; a revisable governance loop is not. The system must know: “I am operating under assumptions that may change.” This is robustness, not weakness.
9. Human Identity as an Axiomatic System
A person lives by axioms like “I am the kind of person who...” or “This matters to me.” These are not eternal truths; they are working commitments. Mental health collapses when axioms become either unquestionable (rigidity) or nonexistent (drift). Stability lives in revisable commitment.
10. Conclusion
After foundations collapse, nihilism is not the default—design is. We do not discover final truths. We construct interfaces that hold under pressure, fail informatively, and preserve the ability to adapt.
Axioms are not what reality is. They are how systems move forward without lying to themselves.
