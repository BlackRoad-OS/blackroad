A “27-step customer journey” isn’t one single famous universal model — it’s usually a very granular way of mapping the path from “never heard of you” → “diehard advocate” so your marketing + sales + onboarding teams stop dropping people in the cracks.
Here’s a solid 27-step marketing + sales customer journey you can steal and tailor (works for B2B or B2C; just swap the channels/touchpoints).
27-step customer journey model (Awareness → Advocacy)
Stage 1: Unaware → Aware (Reach)
1. Unaware – They don’t know the problem is solvable.

2. Problem agitation – Something makes the pain obvious (event, stat, story).

3. First exposure – They see you (ad, post, mention, search result).

4. Pattern recognition – “Oh… this is about my situation.”

5. Interest click – Click / tap / watch / open.

6. Micro-engagement – Like, save, follow, 10s watch, scroll depth.

7. Retargetable – Pixel/email capture starts (cookie, view-through, etc.).

Stage 2: Curious → Consideration (Education + Trust)
   8. Landing page intake – Clear promise + proof + next step.

   9. Credibility check – They scan reviews, logos, credentials, founder, FAQ.

   10. Value preview – Lead magnet, demo video, calculator, case study.

   11. Email/SMS opt-in – They give contact info.

   12. Nurture touch #1 – Welcome + “here’s what you’ll get.”

   13. Nurture touch #2 – Education content addressing objections.

   14. Comparison behavior – They compare alternatives (“you vs X”).

   15. Social proof deep dive – Testimonials, community, before/after, results.

Stage 3: High intent → Conversion (Sales)
      16. High-intent action – Book call / start trial / add to cart / request quote.

      17. Qualification – Fit check (budget/use case/timeline).

      18. Discovery – They articulate needs; you reflect and diagnose.

      19. Tailored solution – Plan/package mapped to their goals.

      20. Offer + terms – Pricing, timeline, guarantee, risk reversal.

      21. Friction moment – Objections / internal approval / “I need to think.”

      22. Commitment – Checkout / contract / invoice / payment.

      23. Confirmation – Receipt + “what happens next” clarity.

Stage 4: Onboarding → Activation (Deliver value fast)
         24. Onboarding kickoff – Setup steps + success path.

         25. First value (“Aha”) – The moment they feel benefit (activation event).

         26. Habit loop – They repeat the core action; reminders + templates help.

Stage 5: Retention → Expansion → Advocacy (Grow)
            27. Retention + expansion + advocacy – Renew, upgrade, refer, review, share story.

How to use this (so it’s not just a list)
               * For each step, define:

                  * Customer question (“Is this legit?” “Will this work for me?”)

                  * Best touchpoint (ad, page, email, call, demo, onboarding checklist)

                  * Metric (CTR, opt-in %, booked calls, close rate, activation rate, churn, NPS)

If you tell me what you sell (B2B SaaS? course? ecom? local service?) I’ll tailor the 27 steps into a real map with specific channels, messages, and the one metric that matters at each step.
