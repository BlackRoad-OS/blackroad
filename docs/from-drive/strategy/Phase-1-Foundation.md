PHASE 1: FOUNDATION
BlackRoad OS Development Roadmap
Timeline: Q1 2026 (Jan - Mar)


━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━


OBJECTIVE
Establish core infrastructure and prove the fundamental architecture works end-to-end.


SUCCESS CRITERIA
✓ Single agent with persistent memory running on local hardware
✓ Memory persists across restarts using PS-SHA∞
✓ Event bus routing messages between components
✓ Basic web interface at blackroad.io

2. MEMORY PERSISTENCE (PS-SHA∞)
Owner: Cecilia
Status: [ ]


Tasks:
☐ Design append-only journal schema
☐ Implement cryptographic hash chain

3. EVENT BUS ARCHITECTURE
Owner: Cecilia
Status: [ ]


Tasks:

4. HARDWARE LAYER
Owner: Cecilia
Status: [ ]


Tasks:
☐ Configure Lucidia (Pi 5s) for inference
☐ Set up Alice (Pi 400) as gateway

Dependencies: Physical hardware
Deliverable: Operational cluster




5. WEB PRESENCE
Owner: Cecilia
Status: [ ]


Tasks:

WEEKLY MILESTONES


Week 1 (Jan 27): Hardware cluster online, basic NATS running
Week 2 (Feb 3): Lucidia core v0.1, memory schema defined
Week 3 (Feb 10): First persistent memory write/read cycle
Week 4 (Feb 17): Event bus routing between components
Week 5 (Feb 24): End-to-end demo: query → agent → memory → response
Week 6 (Mar 3): blackroad.io live with status dashboard
Week 7 (Mar 10): Documentation and cleanup
Week 8 (Mar 17): Phase 1 review and Phase 2 planning

RISKS


1. Hardware limitations on Pi for LLM inference
   Mitigation: Offload to Jetson Orin or cloud fallback


2. Memory schema complexity
   Mitigation: Start simple, iterate


3. Solo developer bandwidth
   Mitigation: Ruthless prioritization, MVP mindset
