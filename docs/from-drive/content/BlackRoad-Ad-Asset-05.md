// STRATEGIC_META_DATA
* Psychographic Trigger: Addresses "Cognitive Sovereignty." It targets the deep-seated discomfort professionals feel when they are forced to use "black box" systems.
* Resonance Goal: This is a "Scroll-Stopper" through visual silence. It invites immediate self-selection; those who value agency will feel an instant affinity for the brand.
* Competitive Pivot: Implicitly critiques the entire "Black Box AI" industry without naming a single competitor. It frames understanding as a moral/professional requirement rather than a feature.
