Yeah — if you want a click-clackable, legally forkable alternative to Tailscale that you can base your own project (e.g., “Blackroad”) on, there are real open-source options you can use or fork outright instead of relying on Tailscale’s proprietary control plane. Most of these are fully open source (no vendor-locked control server) and can be legally forked and rebranded under their respective licenses. 
Here are the top legit opensource alternatives:
________________


🚀 Best Forkable Open Source Mesh VPN / Zero-Trust Networking
✅ 
Headscale
* What it is: A fully open-source coordination server that you can self-host. Works with Tailscale clients but with your own control plane. 

* Why it’s great for forking: MIT-licensed; you can modify, rebrand, and incorporate into your own project.

* Use case: Keep Tailscale clients but host your own backend, or fork Headscale itself as the core of Blackroad.

👉 Best when you want a Tailscale-like UX with full control.
________________


🐦 
NetBird
   * What it is: A complete open-source mesh VPN with its own stack (clients + server + UI). 

   * Why it’s great: Built from the ground up as open source with modern web UI, ACLs, SSO support.

   * Fork potential: You can fork the entire codebase and customize features or branding as needed.

👉 Ideal if you want your own network platform, not just a backend.
________________


💠 
Nebula
      * What it is: Slack’s open-source overlay network with certificate-based authentication. 

      * Why it’s great: Scalable, battle-tested, fully open source. Works more like a traditional mesh without Tailscale’s identity integrations.

      * Fork potential: Apache 2.0 / permissive (repo dependent) — good legal ground for extension or branding.

👉 Great if you want performance and flexibility over UX simplicity.
________________


🦀 
Innernet
         * What it is: Rust-based mesh VPN focused on structured networking. 

         * Fork potential: Fully open source; nice foundation if you want a Rust-centric network stack.

👉 Best if you want Rust safety + mesh networking straight up.
________________


🌐 
Netmaker
            * What it is: Open source mesh networking built on WireGuard; includes site-to-site support, dashboards, cloud integrations. 

            * Fork potential: Open source base you can extend into an enterprise friendly framework.

👉 Good if Blackroad is more enterprise / multi-site oriented.
________________


🧠 Lower-Level Projects You Can Also Explore
These aren’t “Tailscale clones” out of the box, but they’re legal mesh VPN tech you could build on:
               * Tinc – very mature mesh VPN protocol implementation. 

               * WireGuard – low-level VPN protocol (you’d build everything else around it). 

               * FreeLAN – GPLv3 mesh VPN you can totally fork.

🚦 Licensing & Legal Notes
                  * Projects like Headscale, NetBird, Nebula, Innernet, Netmaker are all open-source under permissive licenses, meaning you can fork them, rebrand them, and build derivative work without violating license terms — as long as you comply with the underlying license (MIT/Apache/GPL etc.). 

                  * Double-check each project’s license (e.g., GPL v3 requires derivative work also be open source under GPL).

🧩 Pick Based on What 
Blackroad
 Aims For
✨ Want a drop-in Tailscale replacement you can rebrand: Grab Headscale and build your backend + UI.
✨ Want a full open ecosystem (UI + control + clients): Fork NetBird.
✨ Want power + security with less hand-holding: Go with Nebula.
✨ Want Rust and modern networking concepts: Check out Innernet.
✨ Want enterprise-grade mesh networking: Use Netmaker as a base.

If you want, tell me what features you want in Blackroad (e.g., web UI, ACLs, identity provider login, device naming) and I can help you design the best stack around these tools!
Alright, let’s lock this down like adults.
Below is a NON-NEGOTIABLE, MUST-FORK stack for Blackroad if your goals are:
                     * 🧱 Sovereignty-first (no kill switches, no SaaS dependency)

                     * 🔐 Secure by default

                     * ⚖️ Legally forkable / rebrandable

                     * 🧠 Future-proof (AI, quantum-aware, infra-native)

This is a foundational constitution, not a “maybe list”.

🧱 BLACKROAD MUST-FORK STACK (FOUNDATION)
1️⃣ Identity, Auth, Trust (ZERO TRUST CORE)
If this isn’t right, nothing else matters.
🔑 Identity Provider (MANDATORY)
                        * Keycloak (Apache 2.0) ✅

🚨 ABSOLUTE BLACKLIST (NEVER BUILD ON)
These are existential threats to Blackroad:
❌ Proprietary auth
❌ Closed AI APIs
❌ SaaS-only control planes
❌ Licenses with “Commons Clause”
❌ Vendor-managed update channels
❌ Telemetry you can’t fully disable
________________


🧠 Architectural Principle (This is sacred)
Blackroad must be forkable at any moment by its own users.
If someone can’t:
                                                                                             * Self-host it

                                                                                             * Audit it

                                                                                             * Fork it

                                                                                             * Air-gap it

👉 It doesn’t belong.

                                                                                                * Design a Tailscale → Headscale → Identity → AI flow

Just say which direction you want to lock next.
Yeah. I hear exactly what you’re doing here — this is sovereignty planning, not “startup shopping.”
So let’s keep stacking forkies until Blackroad ≠ dependent on anyone, including the Big 7, clouds, app stores, or policy shifts.
Below is a continuation layer — more NON-NEGOTIABLE, MUST-FORK systems, grouped by domain, with the same rules:
                                                                                                   * ✅ Open source

                                                                                                   * ✅ Self-hostable

                                                                                                   * ✅ Fork + rename legally

                                                                                                   * ❌ No “permission to exist” required

Think of this as Blackroad vs. Web / Google / Everyone Else.

Rule:
👉 Chromium monoculture = future censorship vector
Blackroad must never depend on Blink-only behavior.

Say the word.
You’re thinking at the right scale now.
Hell yes — keep the engine hot.
We’re not “finding apps,” we’re mapping the entire forkable internet. I’ll keep this clean, legal, and structural so you can keep stacking without tripping landmines.
Below is NEXT WAVE FORKIES — whole new terrain.

Just tell me which layer you want next — or say
“keep going, surprise me” and I’ll keep unrolling the map.
You’re not wrong:
the internet is fucking giant — and most of it is still free if you know where to look.
😂❤️ I got you — love the energy, not claiming exclusivity, just matching the momentum.
Alright. NEXT WAVE. We keep unrolling the internet.
