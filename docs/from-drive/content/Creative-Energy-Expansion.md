Analytical Expansion: The Creative Energy Equation
From Conceptual Aphorism to Mathematical Formalism
In the Amundson Equations (v1.8), Section III defines the Creative Energy Equation as:
“Creation is an exponential function of contradiction (tension) acting upon a bounded rational state.”
This document provides the formal mathematical expansion of this principle, defining the functional behaviors of Energy (K) and Coherence (C) through calculus and series approximation.
I. The Functional Forms
To satisfy the requirement that contradiction fuels creation exponentially while coherence provides a saturating boundary, we define the following primitives:
1. Creative Energy (K)
The fuel of the system is modeled by the exponential growth of tension \delta:
Where \lambda represents the system's sensitivity to contradiction. This aligns with the Master Constant \delta_A = e and the behavior of the Wick Bridge (e^{i\pi t}).
2. The Coherence Boundary (C)
The bounded rational state is modeled by a hyperbolic tangent function, ensuring the system remains "contained" as tension rises:
This function starts at 0 (no structure required in stasis) and asymptotically approaches 1 (maximum structural saturation) as \delta \to \infty.
II. Taylor Series Expansion (Small Residue Analysis)
To understand how creation emerges from minor feedback residues in the equilibrium Z, we expand these functions as power series around the point of stasis (\delta = 0).
1. Expansion of Energy (K)
For small tensions, the exponential growth is approximated by the sum of its derivatives:
Interpretation: For negligible contradiction, the system retains its Identity (1). As tension \delta enters the system, growth begins linearly (\delta), but quickly introduces non-linear complexity through quadratic and cubic terms.
2. Expansion of Coherence (C)
The boundary emerges linearly but is dampened by higher-order structural constraints:
Interpretation: At the onset of contradiction, the boundary (C) grows at the same rate as the tension. However, the cubic term (-\delta^3/3) represents the "structural resistance" that prevents the boundary from growing infinitely, forcing it toward saturation.
III. The Combined Creation Metric
When we integrate these two functions to represent "Creation acting upon a bounded state," we arrive at the Amundson Creation Metric (\mathcal{K}):

	IV. Philosophical Implications
1. The Linear-to-Exponential Bridge: Minor contradictions are handled by simple adaptation (the linear terms of the Taylor expansion). Major contradictions trigger the higher-order terms, leading to the "Phase Shift" identified in the Amundson Identity (K = -1).
2. Boundary Emergence: Coherence does not exist before contradiction. It is a reactive boundary that crystallizes as a function of tension. Without \delta, C is null.
3. The Inversion Point: When the combined metric \mathcal{K} reaches the magnitude of the unit rotation, the system undergoes the inversion required for a "New Identity."
