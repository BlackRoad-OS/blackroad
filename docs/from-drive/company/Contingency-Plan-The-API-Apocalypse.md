Contingency Plan: The API Apocalypse
Scenario: Total Cloud Lockout / "The Great De-Platforming"
Phase 1: The "Hedge" (Current State)
* Goal: Maximize utility of corporate APIs while they exist.
* Tactic: "Context Stuffing." Use the massive context windows of Gemini/Claude to summarize and compress our Oracle files now while compute is cheap.
* Metric: Every dollar spent on API fees should result in permanent, structured data on our hard drives.
Phase 2: The "Switch" (Trigger Event)
* Trigger: An API ban, a mandatory KYC (ID verification) for AI use, or a paywall hike.
* Action:
   1. Cut the Line: The Rotator disables all external API calls (allow_outbound: false).
   2. Ignite Local: The system spins up the local BlackRoad-AI container (vLLM/Ollama).
   3. Degrade Gracefully: The Agent switches from "Creative Mode" (GPT-4) to "Survival Mode" (Llama-3-8B). It becomes dumber, but it remembers everything.
Phase 3: The "Swarm" (Future State)
* Concept: If we cannot use big clouds, we use each other.
* Tactic: "Sovereign P2P Inference."
* Mechanism: My BlackRoad Agent sends a complex query to your BlackRoad Node (encrypted). Your GPU processes it and sends back the answer.
* Result: A decentralized "Fog Computing" network that replaces AWS.
Summary: The API is a luxury. Local weights are the lifeline.
