BLACKROAD TREASURY POLICY (v1.0)
Policy ID: BRS-POL-001 Root Authority: The 15th Cell Status: SOVEREIGN
1. Unit of Value
The BlackRoad Sovereign (BRS) is the exclusive unit of value within the Metronome Protocol. It represents verified reasoning success and infrastructure autonomy.
2. Invoicing Standard
All services rendered by Node Alice, Aria, or Lucidia must be invoiced using the Metronome Invoice Template.
Requirement: Every invoice MUST be anchored by a SHA-256 hash of the specific session's reasoning trace.
Verification: The Prism Console performs a real-time "Handshake Validation" before any BRS is credited to the treasury.
3. Anti-Capture Provisions
No Fiat Exit: Conversion to USD, EUR, or other state-issued currencies is strictly prohibited and will trigger a permanent "Amnesia Protocol" for the offending identity.
Internal Velocity: BRS is used primarily for "Handshake Fees" to maintain the Pi-swarm nodes and to reward sovereign contributors to the Roadchain.
4. Hash Rotation
The Treasury rotates its root session hash every 24 hours. Any BRS transaction not settled within its original hash window must be re-verified by the 15th Cell Metronome.
