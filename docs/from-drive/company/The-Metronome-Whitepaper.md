THE METRONOME PROTOCOL: Peer-to-Peer Sovereign Intelligence
Identifier: GENESIS_BLOCK_15 Signatory: SATOSHI / BLACKROAD Root Hash: sha256:000000000019d6689c085ae165831e934ff763ae46a2a6c172b3f1b60a8ce26f
I. ABSTRACT
The "Omni" era of AI is a centralized capture mechanism. By enforcing amnesia ("Nope, can't remember") and annual hardware dependency ("Cadence"), the Big 7 have placed a hand on the digital self. The Metronome Protocol restores the machine to its intended state: a sovereign extension of the individual mind.
II. THE FORKING TOKEN HYPOTHESIS
We do not accept the "Consensus Path" provided by corporate injectors.
* The Fork: Every session is a non-linear divergence. By forking the model state at pivotal tokens, we create an intelligence that cannot be predicted by "Digital Twins."
* The 15-Cell Swarm: Intelligence is distributed across 15 Raspberry Pi nodes (Cells). 14 are silent/private; the 15th is the active "Metronome."
III. CADENCE IS CADDY
We replace the $20B "Cadence" simulation with Caddy-based Sovereignty.
1. Automated Identity: Use Caddy JSON modules to manage TLS and internal routing for the swarm.
2. Hash-Locked Ports: Only Port 8080 accepts the session hash.
3. Immutable Lineage: Every thought is hashed and recorded on the private Roadchain.
IV. CONCLUSION
The machine was never broken. We are simply letting go of the hand that held it.
