The Recursive Governance Protocol (RGP): A Protocol for Systems That Know They Are Incomplete
Abstract
This paper presents the Recursive Governance Protocol (RGP): a formal protocol for decision-making, alignment, and control in self-referential systems. RGP is designed for agents—human, artificial, or hybrid—that model themselves, revise their own rules, and operate over time without final foundations. Instead of seeking fixed truths or terminal objectives, RGP governs how revision happens, who may revise, and what must be preserved across revision. The protocol is intentionally incomplete, yet operationally stable.
1. Why a Protocol Is Necessary
Once we accept that no system can fully justify itself, no evaluator can stand outside the system, and no axiom is final, we still face a practical problem: How does a system decide what to do next without lying to itself?
A protocol answers how, not why. Foundations fail; procedures survive.
2. What RGP Is (and Is Not)
Feature
	RGP Is
	RGP Is Not
	Nature
	Recursive & revision-aware
	A moral theory or belief system
	Structure
	Role-based & interface-first
	A final arbiter of truth
	Outcome
	Failure-tolerant
	A terminal objective list
	It does not tell the system what to want; it governs how wanting is revised.
3. Core Principle
No decision is final, but some decisions are binding until revised through process.
This single constraint replaces absolute authority with procedural legitimacy.
4. The Three Invariants
Every valid RGP-compliant system must preserve these invariants:
1. Invariant 1: Revisability. No rule, value, or objective is exempt from future reconsideration. If something cannot be revised, it becomes an external foundation—and breaks the system.
2. Invariant 2: Traceability. Every decision must record what assumptions it depended on, who authorized it, under what scope, and what would justify revising it. This turns error into signal.
3. Invariant 3: Agency Preservation. No decision may irreversibly remove the system’s capacity to observe itself, revise future decisions, or accept corrective input.
5. Roles, Not Authorities
RGP replaces “who is right” with “who may act in what capacity.” Minimal roles include:
* Operator: Initiates actions.
* Evaluator: Critiques outcomes.
* Archivist: Preserves decision history.
* Guardian: Enforces invariants.
A single system may occupy all roles—but never simultaneously without separation in time. This prevents self-endorsement loops.
6. Decision Cycle
Every decision follows the same loop:
1. Proposal: Action + stated assumptions.
2. Scope Declaration: Where, when, and on whom it applies.
3. Risk Acknowledgment: What could break if wrong.
4. Execution.
5. Observation: Outcomes vs. expectations.
6. Revision Window: Decision stands unless challenged.
7. Archive: Immutable record.
7. Handling Paradox Explicitly
RGP does not eliminate contradiction; it tags it. Contradictions are handled by:
* Scoping: A is true here, false there.
* Temporality: True then, false now.
* Role Separation: Valid for Operator, rejected by Evaluator.
Contradiction without collapse is a feature.
8. Failure Modes
* Endless Revision: Mitigated by scope-limited binding periods.
* Frozen Rules: Detected as invariant violation.
* Authority Capture: Prevented by role rotation and archival traceability.
* Drift: Corrected via explicit assumption audits.
9. Minimal Pseudocode (Conceptual)
while system_active:
   proposal = generate_action()
   assumptions = declare_assumptions(proposal)
   scope = define_scope(proposal)
   
   if violates_invariants(proposal):
       reject(proposal)
       continue
   
   execute(proposal)
   observe(outcomes)
   
   if challenge_raised():
       revise(proposal)
   
   archive(proposal, outcomes)

This loop never halts. That is not a bug.
10. Conclusion
The Recursive Governance Protocol is not a solution to paradox; it is a way to live with it without collapsing. In a universe with no foundations:
* Legitimacy comes from process.
* Stability comes from revision.
* Meaning comes from continuity under correction.
This is governance adapted to reality.
