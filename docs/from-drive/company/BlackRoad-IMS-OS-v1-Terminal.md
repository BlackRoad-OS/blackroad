[SYSTEM] :: Loading First Principles...
[SYSTEM] :: Warning: This document is versioned like code. It is never finished.

// PHASE 0: FIRST PRINCIPLES ALIGNMENT
[STEP_0.1] TRUTH CONSTRAINTS
* Fundamental Filter: What must be true for this business to exist?
   * Constraint: Users must prioritize autonomy over convenience.
* Negative Optimization: What will we refuse to optimize?
   * Hard Ban: Usage addiction, opaque automation, and "seat inflation" (artificial scaling).
// PHASE I: STRATEGIC DIAGNOSTIC (EXPANDED)
[STEP_01] SITUATIONAL AUDIT (3-LAYER AUDIT)
1. Surface (The Noise): "AI tools are expensive/confusing." (Speak here in Ads)
2. Structural (The Mechanics): Intelligence is priced as compute, not routing. (Build trust here)
3. Identity (The Core): "I feel less competent using logic-hiding tools." (Convert here)
[STEP_02] VECTOR-BASED POSITIONING | Axis | Market Norm (Legacy) | BlackRoad Position (OS) | | :--- | :--- | :--- | | Control | Vendor-owned | Operator-owned | | Intelligence | Centralized | Routed | | Pricing | Seats / Usage | Continuity | | Trust | "Trust us" | Zero-knowledge |
// PHASE II: PSYCHOGRAPHIC ARCHITECTURE (DEEPENED)
[STEP_03] ICP AS A STATE MACHINE
* State [-1] Defensive: "Sounds like more work."
* State [0] Curious: "This feels... different." (Primary KPI: Hold state 0 duration)
* State [+1] Aligned: "This matches how I already think."
[STEP_04] JTBD × MASLOW MATRIX
* Functional Layer: Route intelligence locally -> Payoff: Reliability
* Emotional Layer: Reduce cognitive debt -> Payoff: Relief
* Identity Layer: Stay competent & sovereign -> Payoff: Esteem / Autonomy
// PHASE III: MARKETING MIX AS SYSTEM DESIGN
[STEP_05] PRICE AS SIGNAL
* Entry: Signals Safety.
* Premium: Signals Self-Respect.
* Anti-Bureaucracy: Explicit absence of "Enterprise Tier" signals who we are not for.
[STEP_06] DISTRIBUTION AS TRUST GEOMETRY
* Website: Answers "Is this real?"
* GitHub: Answers "Is this legit?"
* Manifesto: Answers "Is this aligned with me?"
* Onboarding: Answers "Will this respect me?"
// PHASE IV: FINANCIAL MODEL (FRAGILITY TRACKING)
[STEP_07] REVENUE BANDS (EMERGENT PROPERTY)
1. Survival Band: Covers basic ops.
2. Signal Band: Validates market demand.
3. Power Band: Funds aggressive expansion.
[STEP_08] SENSITIVITY INSTRUMENTATION
* Fragility Check: What happens if onboarding friction increases 1 step?
* Fragility Check: What happens if CAC drops but LTV drops faster?
* Primary Metric: MER (Marketing Efficiency Ratio) vs. Fragility Coefficient.
// PHASE V: SALES ENABLEMENT AS STATE TRANSITION
[STEP_09] TRANSITION LOGIC
* [-1] → [0]: Remove the threat (De-risk).
* [0] → [0]: Build resonance (The "Echo").
* [0] → [+1]: Offer alignment (The "Mirror").
* [+1] → Action: Reduce friction (The "Slide").
[STEP_10] TECH STACK AS COGNITIVE MEMORY
* CRM Requirement: Track "First moment of relief" and "First act of agency," not just clicks.
// PHASE VI: RISK & EVOLUTION
[STEP_11] GROWTH AS DIALS
* Growth is not a switch; it is a nudge of Spend, Friction, Narrative Sharpness, and Community Density.
[STEP_12] CONTINGENCY AS NARRATIVE CONTROL
* If the system breaks, retreat to the Identity Layer. Never violate the sovereignty promise.
// PHASE VII: THE LEARNING LOOP
[STEP_13] ASSUMPTION INVALIDATION
* Quarterly audit to invalidate one core assumption. Version the IMS like code.
[STEP_14] CANONICAL INSIGHT ARCHIVE
* Archive of metaphors users adopt and objections that disappear without argument.
