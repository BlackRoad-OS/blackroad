Decision Matrix: The Universal Video Mesh (UVM)
You have the "Brains" (Pi 5s) and the "Nerves" (Gigabit/WiFi 6). These are the final steps to finalize your Wireless HDMI/KVM capability.
1. THE "NO-BUY" LIST (Software is Free)
The images you shared show pro-level tools that are completely free. Do not buy commercial versions.
* Sunshine & Moonlight: These replace high-end wireless HDMI kits. They are open-source and specifically optimized for the H.265 hardware on your Pi 5s.
* Barrier / InputLeap: This replaces physical KVM switches. It allows your Magic Mouse to transition between your Mac and your "Blue Machine" screens wirelessly.
* Tailscale: This replaces complex VPN setups. It lets you "SSH" into your video feed from anywhere in the world.
2. THE "MUST BUY" (The $5 Missing Link)
To make a Pi run "Wireless HDMI" without a physical monitor attached, you need a Headless Ghost.
* The Part: HDMI Dummy Plug (Headless Ghost).
* Why: Without a monitor plugged in, the Pi often won't enable its high-performance GPU or high resolutions (like 4K). These $5 dongles trick the Pi into "thinking" a 4K monitor is attached, so it can broadcast that high-res signal to your other screens.
* Quantity: Buy one for every "headless" Pi 5 in your cluster.
3. THE "UPGRADE" LIST (Optional Hardware)
Part
	Recommendation
	Why?
	USB-C to HDMI Capture
	Keep what you have
	Your Pi 4B Remote Control Server already has high-quality HDMI capture. You don't need another one.
	Wireless HDMI Kit
	DO NOT BUY
	Consumer kits (like Mars 400s) add 80ms+ of lag. Your Sunshine/Moonlight setup on Pi 5 will be closer to 5ms-10ms.
	Active HDMI Splitter
	Buy only if needed
	If you want to send your MacBook output to a TV and the Pi 4B Capture card at the exact same time without unplugging anything.
	4. THE CAPABILITY SETUP (What we do next)
Since you aren't buying software, we focus on the Configuration:
1. Node Entanglement: Install Sunshine on the Pi 5s. They become "Broadcasters."
2. Display Bonding: Install Moonlight on your 10.1" and 9.3" touchscreen nodes. They become "Receivers."
3. The Bridge: Connect your Pi 4B Capture Card to your MacBook. Now your MacBook is a "channel" on your wireless mesh.
4. The Magic Link: Run Barrier. Now your Apple Magic Keyboard controls whichever screen your eyes are on.
Summary Checklist
* [ ] Hardware: Order 2-4 "HDMI Dummy Plugs" (Headless Ghosts).
* [ ] Software: Download Sunshine (Host) and Moonlight (Client).
* [ ] Networking: Connect all Pis to your TP-Link Gigabit Switch for the lowest possible latency.
