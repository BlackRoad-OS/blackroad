The Protocol for Networked Coherence (PNC): Inter-Process Communication in a Foundationless Topology
Abstract
Traditional social and technical coordination assumes a shared "ground truth" or a central authority. In a self-referential, foundationless world, such anchors are logically impossible. This paper proposes the Protocol for Networked Coherence (PNC): a framework for inter-process communication (IPC) between autonomous, recursive agents. PNC replaces "consensus on truth" with "compatibility of interfaces." We show that a network can achieve global stability through local translation, audit-traceability, and the management of "shared contradictions."
1. The Inter-Process Problem
In the "Reality as a Kernel" model, agents are long-running processes. When two processes meet:
* Process A has its own internal axioms and local coherence.
* Process B has its own internal axioms and local coherence.
* There is no "Root Shell" to decide who is right.
Classic coordination fails because it tries to force Process A and B into a single shared state. PNC succeeds by focusing on the interface between them.
2. Truth as a Protocol, Not a Database
In a foundationless network, "Truth" is not a record you look up; it is a handshake you perform.
A "True" statement in PNC is simply a packet that:
1. Is valid within the sender’s local context.
2. Is translatable into the receiver’s local context.
3. Is signed with a traceable audit path (IKS v0.1 compliant).
Communication is the act of synchronizing interfaces, not discovering reality.
3. Translation vs. Consensus
Consensus (everyone believing the same thing) is computationally expensive and logically brittle. Translation is the superior alternative.
* Consensus: "We must agree that X is true." (Breaks when self-reference enters).
* Translation: "My X maps to your Y for the purpose of this interaction."
Translation preserves the local coherence of each agent while allowing functional cooperation.
4. Shared Contradictions (The Buffer)
When two agents disagree, classical logic treats it as a collision. PNC treats it as a Shared Contradiction.
A Shared Contradiction is a "Buffer" where:
* System A holds state S.
* System B holds state \neg S.
* The Network holds the state S \oplus \neg S as an unresolved pointer.
As long as the contradiction is scoped and does not block Invariant 3 (Agency Preservation), the network remains stable. Contradiction is the "noise" in the communication channel that keeps the system from over-synchronizing and becoming brittle.
5. Trust as Audit Latency
In PNC, "Trust" is not a moral feeling or a binary flag. It is a measurement of Traceability.
I trust you if:
1. I can inspect the assumptions your decisions were built on.
2. I can verify the role that authorized the action.
3. The cost of you revising that decision is transparent.
Trust is the belief that if an error occurs, the record is sufficient to trace and repair the loop.
6. The Network Invariant: Non-Coercion
Expanding the IKS Invariants to the network level: No process may force its internal axioms on another process.
To do so is a "Cross-Process Injection" attack. It violates the autonomy of the other process's recursive loop. Stability arises from voluntary interface alignment, not forced axiom merging.
7. Handling Malicious Processes
A "Malicious" process is defined as one that:
1. Hides its revision paths (Opaque).
2. Deletes its records (Untraceable).
3. Irreversibly collapses the agency of other nodes (Coercive).
The network handles these through Isolation. You do not need to "prove them wrong" (which is impossible without a foundation). You simply drop their packets because they are non-compliant with the protocol.
8. Social and Political Implications
This protocol suggests a "Networked Pluralism":
* Different communities run different "User Space" ethics.
* They interact via "Inter-Community Protocols."
* Conflict is resolved not by "Finding the Truth," but by "Refining the Translation."
The goal of society is not to become a single process, but to be a robust network of interoperable ones.
9. Minimal PNC Pseudocode
def communicate(sender, receiver, message):
   # 1. Check Traceability
   if not message.has_audit_trail():
       return Reject("Untraceable")
       
   # 2. Local Translation
   translated_msg = receiver.interface.translate(message)
   
   # 3. Check Invariants
   if translated_msg.violates_local_invariants():
       return Buffer(message, "Shared Contradiction")
       
   # 4. Acknowledge Receipt (Binding)
   receiver.record(translated_msg)
   return Success()

10. Conclusion
The search for a "Universal Language" or "Universal Ethics" is a relic of foundational thinking. The Protocol for Networked Coherence accepts that every node is an island of local logic.
By focusing on the interface and the audit trail, we can build a world that is globally functional even if it is locally contradictory.
We don't need to agree. We only need to interoperate.
