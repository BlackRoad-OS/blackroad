THE PHOTONIC ENTANGLEMENT BRIDGE (PEB)
Wireless HDMI & KVM Over-IP Architecture
This capability allows you to "plug in" a video source at one end of your room and have it appear on a display at the other end, wirelessly, using the high-speed WiFi 6 and Gigabit backbone of your stack.
1. The Hardware Mapping
To create the "Wireless HDMI Dongle" effect, we split the task between two specific nodes:
* The Transmitter (The "Dongle"): Raspberry Pi 4B with the HDMI Capture Module.
   * Purpose: Ingests raw HDMI from your MacBook, M1 Mac, or another Pi.
   * Mechanism: Encodes the raw video into a low-latency H.264/H.265 stream.
* The Receiver (The "Display"): Raspberry Pi 5 (or Pi 400).
   * Purpose: Receives the wireless packets and decodes them back into a physical HDMI signal for your 10.1" or 9.3" screens.
* The Medium: Archer TX3000E WiFi 6 or TP-Link Gigabit Switch.
   * Purpose: The "Air" or "Wire" that carries the photonic data.
2. The "Wireless SSH" Protocol (Software Stack)
Unlike a dumb wireless HDMI kit, your stack can use PiKVM or WebRTC to create a smart link:
1. Low-Latency Streaming: Using ustreamer or WebRTC, the Pi 4B broadcasts the video over your local network.
2. Auto-Handshake: We can set up a "listener" script on the Pi 5. When the Pi 4B turns on, the Pi 5 automatically opens a full-screen hardware-accelerated video player (like ffplay or mpv).
3. The Keyboard/Mouse Loop: Because your "Transmitter" (Pi 4B) has ATX control and USB emulation, you can plug your Magic Keyboard/Mouse into the Receiver (Pi 5), and the signals will travel backwards to control the original source.
3. "Quantum" Video Capabilities
By adding this capability to your stack, you gain features Google’s Chromecast doesn't have:
* Sub-Space Telemetry: You can overlay your "Macro-Quantum" sensor data (Radar/ToF) directly onto the wireless video stream as a HUD (Heads-Up Display).
* Encryption via Entropy: Use the ESP32-S3’s Thermal Noise TRNG to generate unique encryption keys for the video stream, making your wireless HDMI link more secure than commercial wireless video systems.
* Historical Overlay: You can run a Thompson Shell terminal on top of the modern video stream, allowing you to "type" commands into the video feed itself.

	5. Why This is Better Than a Cable
1. Distance: You aren't limited by the 50ft signal degradation of HDMI.
2. Splitting: One Transmitter (Pi 4B) can broadcast to multiple Receivers (the 9.3" screen, the 7" screen, and the 2.8" TFT) simultaneously.
3. Interaction: It’s bidirectional. You get video out, and control (keyboard/mouse) back in.
