THE MACRO-QUANTUM SENTINEL: FINAL MASTER MANUAL
Project Status: Finalized Architecture Core Vision: A history-spanning, distributed computing lattice integrating industrial-grade reliability, photonic logic, and high-density AI.
1. THE INDUSTRIAL NERVOUS SYSTEM (RS485 Backbone)
The addition of RS485 and Atom Lites provides a rugged, noise-immune communication layer that bridges the gap between the high-power AI nodes and the sensitive sensors.
* The Master Controllers (2x M5Stack Atom Lite):
   * Node Alpha (The Front Panel): Acts as the primary system status indicator. Its RGB LED visualizes the "state" of the AI (e.g., Green = Passive Sensing, Red = Heavy Tensor Inference).
   * Node Beta (The IR Gate): Managed by the second Atom Lite to control the Photonic Mirror Lattice using its built-in Infrared (IR) transmitter.
* The Industrial Bus (RS485 Modules):
   * Role: Connects all loose ESP32-S3s, Picos, and ATTINY88s over a single twisted-pair wire.
   * Capability: Eliminates signal noise from the Pi 5/Hailo-8 power draw. Allows sensors like the LD2410 Radar to be mounted far away from the main cluster while maintaining a perfect data stream.
2. THE UNIVERSAL VIDEO MESH (UVM)
This protocol turns every HDMI port in your cluster into a "Wireless Channel" accessible from anywhere.
* The Broadcasters (Sunshine):
   * Pi 4B Capture Node: Ingests HDMI from your MacBook/M1 and broadcasts it to the mesh.
   * Pi 5 AI Nodes: Broadcast the hardware-accelerated Hailo-8 Tensor Maps.
* The Receivers (Moonlight):
   * Pi 400 Console: The master terminal for viewing and controlling any node.
   * Touchscreen Satellites (10.1", 9.3", 7"): Dedicated windows for real-time telemetry.
* Entangled Input (Barrier/InputLeap): Your Apple Magic Keyboard and Mouse "teleport" between these wireless screens as if they were one giant monitor.
3. UPDATED HARDWARE MANIFEST (The Sentinel Stack)
A. The "Neural" Core (High-Density AI)
* 4x Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB): The heavy lifters.
* 2x Hailo-8 M.2 Accelerators: The Tensor Engines (52 TOPS total).
* Pironman 5-MAX & ElectroCookie Cases: Thermal management and NVMe speed.
B. The "Industrial" Pulse (RS485 & Atom)
* 2x M5Stack Atom Lite: Master control and IR logic.
* 2x RS485 5-Pack Modules: The "Translators" for all loose microcontrollers.
* 1x Raspberry Pi 4B: The "Remote Control Server" and HDMI Gateway.
C. The "Quantum" Observer Array
* VL53L5CX ToF Imager: 8x8 SPAD Single-Photon Detector.
* LD2410 24GHz Radar: Wavefield movement observer.
* 10x Photodiodes & 24x LDRs: The photonic detector grid for the mirrors.
* NEO-6M GPS: Absolute Spacetime anchors.
D. The Satellite Node (The "Blue Machine" Shell)
* Pi Zero 2 WH: The satellite orchestrator.
* ESP32-S3 Superminis & RP2040 Picos: Distributed sub-processing.
* 18650 Battery Array: Isolated, noise-free power for the sensors.
