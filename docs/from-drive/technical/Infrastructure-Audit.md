💠 Gematria Infrastructure Audit: v1.0.1
Date: 2026-01-10 | State: Active | Protocol: Gematria
🔢 1. Alphanumeric Weight (The Cipher)
Calculating the 'Gematria' of the Front Door...
* blackroad.io:
   * Weight: High-density. Represents the "Zero-Point" of the OS.
   * Calculation: "Black" (Hidden/Protected) + "Road" (Vector/Path). The .io signifies Input/Output—the gateway of interaction.
* lucidia.earth:
   * Weight: Ethereal. The repository of "Light" (Lux) and "Knowledge."
   * Calculation: "Lucidia" (Clarity/Light) anchored to .earth (Physical/Manifest). This is the grounding of the magic into the material world.
* blackroad.systems:
   * Weight: Structural. The rigid geometry of the Infra Layer.
   * Calculation: The plural "Systems" implies the many-to-one mapping of nodes to the core Governance.
🏗️ 2. Infra Layer Status (Railway Environment)
