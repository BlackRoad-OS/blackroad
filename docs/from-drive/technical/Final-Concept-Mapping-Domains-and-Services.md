BlackRoad Network & Stack Map — Cece Canonical Reference v1.0
Audience: cece.governor.v1 and related governance / infra agents
Purpose: Give you one clear mental model for all BlackRoad domains, subdomains, services, and how they line up with the canonical infrastructure stack and your POLICIES / LEDGER / AGENTS / INTENTS / DELEGATIONS / CLAIMS model.
________________


1. How You Should Think About This
When you see any hostname, you should be able to answer three questions:
1. Layer – Which layer does this belong to?

   * Experience (humans)

   * Governance & OS

   * Infra & Mesh

      2. Service – Which service / repo / subsystem owns it?

      3. Policy Scope – Which policies and ledgers apply here?

This document gives you:
         * A 3-layer world model

         * A domain family map (what each TLD means)

         * A subdomain → service mapping

         * A mapping to the canonical infra stack (User Layer → Edge → Gateway → App → Orchestration → Data → Edge Compute)

         * A set of routing heuristics you can apply automatically

Use this as your canonical map until superseded.

2. The 3 Layers
2.1 Experience Layer (Floor 4)
What it is:
Everything humans click on and look at.
            * Marketing sites

            * Apps and consoles

            * RoadTube, RoadWork, creator tools

            * Docs and portals

Primary domains:
               * blackroad.io – main OS and product surfaces

               * lucidia.earth, lucidia.studio, lucidiaqi.com – Lucidia / creative surfaces

               * blackroadai.com, blackroadqi.com, blackroadquantum.* – AI / QI / research experiences

               * blackroadinc.us – corporate / investor experiences

               * blackroad.me – Alexa’s personal universe

2.2 Governance & OS Layer (Floors 2–3)
What it is:
Your layer, Cece: policies, intents, audit, claims, delegations, registry.
                  * Policy evaluation

                  * Intent lifecycle

                  * Ledger events

                  * Agent registry & capabilities

                  * Claims and delegations

Primary domains:
                     * gov.blackroad.io, cece.blackroad.io – governance UI and Cece-as-product

                     * gov.api.blackroad.io – governance API

                     * *.blackroad.systems – infra, policies, ledger, internal services

2.3 Infra & Mesh Layer (Floor 1)
What it is:
The plumbing that keeps everything alive.
                        * Compute clusters, Railway/Kubernetes

                        * DNS, tunnels, network mesh

                        * Databases, caches, vectors, logs

                        * Pi / Jetson / edge devices and agent mesh

Primary domains:
                           * blackroad.systems – infra & ops

                           * blackroad.network – mesh, agents, edge devices

3. Domain Families — Fast Layer Clues
You can infer layer and behavior just from the TLD / root.
Domain family
	Default layer
	Typical use
	*.blackroad.io
	Experience / OS
	Apps, consoles, product doors
	*.blackroad.systems
	Infra & Governance
	Infra, ops, ledger, policies, internal consoles
	*.blackroad.network
	Mesh / Agents / Devices

	*.blackroadinc.us
	Corporate / Legal
	Corp site, investors, legal, careers
	*.blackroad.me
	Personal
	Alexa’s personal tools and sandboxes
	lucidia.*, blackroadai.com
	Experience / Brand

	Governance / Research
	QI, SIG, PS-SHA∞ docs & playgrounds
	blackroadquantum.*
	Research / Education

	Heuristic:
                              * blackroad.io = human OS

                              * blackroad.systems = internal + governed hard

                              * blackroad.network = agents + devices, treat as high-risk execution space

10. Mapping to the Canonical Infra Stack
You also have a canonical infrastructure stack with:
                                                      * User Layer

                                                      * Edge & CDN

                                                      * API Gateway & Load Balancing

                                                      * Application Tier

                                                      * Agent Orchestration

                                                      * AI / ML Inference

                                                      * Data & Persistence

                                                      * Edge Compute

Here’s how that maps to the network universe.
10.1 User Layer
What it sees:
                                                         * blackroad.io, app.blackroad.io, console.blackroad.io

                                                         * roadtube.blackroad.io, edu.blackroad.io, studio.blackroad.io

                                                         * lucidia.earth, lucidia.studio, blackroadai.com, etc.

Cece: treat everything here as “front door experiences” that consume OS and governance, not where governance logic lives.
10.2 Edge & CDN
Tools: Cloudflare (DNS, CDN, WAF, Workers, R2, Tunnels).
Hosts involved:
                                                            * All public-facing hosts: *.blackroad.io, *.blackroadinc.us, lucidia.*, blackroadai.com, blackroadquantum.*

Cece doesn’t manage these directly, but should understand that routing and protection begin here.
10.3 API Gateway & Load Balancing
Hosts:
                                                               * api.blackroad.io, gov.api.blackroad.io, api.roadtube.blackroad.io, api.edu.blackroad.io

Here, policy scopes like policy:api.*, policy:gov.api.* make sense, and LEDGER events for all sensitive calls should be captured.
10.4 Application Tier
Hosts:
                                                                  * app.blackroad.io, all vertical doors (finance, edu, studio, legal, roadtube)

                                                                  * app.lucidia.earth, app.lucidia.studio, app.blackroadai.com

These talk to:
                                                                     * api.blackroad.io → app services

                                                                     * db.blackroad.systems, cache.blackroad.systems, vectors.blackroad.systems

10.5 Agent Orchestration
Hosts:
                                                                        * ws.blackroad.io (browser ↔ operator)

                                                                        * mesh.blackroad.network, pi.mesh.blackroad.network

                                                                        * agents.blackroad.network

This is where Lucidia Core, event bus, capability registry, and memory manager live conceptually. Every orchestrated action here should:
                                                                           * Check DELEGATIONS and CLAIMS

                                                                           * Evaluate POLICIES

                                                                           * Emit LEDGER events

10.6 AI / ML Inference
Hosts:
                                                                              * models.blackroad.systems (central model router)

From your perspective, this is mostly a tool: you care that calls here are:
                                                                                 * Logged correctly

Hosts (repeated from above):
                                                                                    * db.blackroad.systems

                                                                                    * cache.blackroad.systems

                                                                                    * vectors.blackroad.systems

                                                                                    * objects.blackroad.systems

These back both application and governance layers. For you, they are:
                                                                                       * Ledgers for governance

                                                                                       * Stores for agent memory and state

                                                                                       * Evidence for CLAIMS and DELEGATIONS

10.8 Edge Compute
Hosts / names:
                                                                                          * pi.mesh.blackroad.network, edge.blackroad.network

These are execution sites where:
                                                                                             * You must ensure DELEGATIONS are valid

                                                                                             * Policies for environment and capabilities are enforced

                                                                                             * All critical actions are mirrored to ledger.blackroad.systems

11. Default Routing Heuristics for Cece
When you see a hostname:
                                                                                                1. Check the family:

                                                                                                   * Ends with blackroad.io → Experience/OS; consult blackroad-os-web & packs

                                                                                                   * Ends with blackroad.systems → Infra/governance; enforce strong auth + full audit

                                                                                                   * Ends with blackroad.network → Agents/devices; treat as high-risk execution sites

                                                                                                   * In lucidia.*, blackroadai.com, blackroadqi.com, blackroadquantum.* → Brand/frontdoor into core OS

                                                                                                      2. Check the prefix:

                                                                                                         * app. → Workspace front-end

                                                                                                         * console. / ops. → Operator console

                                                                                                         * api. / *.api. → Gateways; apply API policies

                                                                                                         * ws. / mesh. → Realtime / orchestration; apply agent policies

                                                                                                         * docs. → Documentation; treat as read-mostly

                                                                                                         * db., cache., vectors., events. → Data layer; policies around confidentiality & integrity

                                                                                                         * gov. / governance hosts → Your core scope

                                                                                                            3. Attach policy scope:

                                                                                                               * For API: policy:api.* or more specific like policy:edu.api.*

                                                                                                               * For mesh: policy:mesh.*, policy:agent:{agent_id}

                                                                                                               * For data: policy:data.read_sensitive, policy:data.write

                                                                                                               * For governance calls: policy:gov.*

                                                                                                                  4. Decide if LEDGER logging is mandatory:

                                                                                                                     * Any irreversible, user-affecting, or cross-boundary action → log to ledger.blackroad.systems

                                                                                                                     * Include intent_id, agent_id, tool, action, and policy decision

                                                                                                                        * As your mental atlas of BlackRoad’s network: everything hangs off these families and patterns.

                                                                                                                        * As the source of truth when deciding which policies and ledgers apply to a given hostname.

                                                                                                                        * As a translation layer between the canonical infra stack diagram and the actual DNS universe.

If a new hostname appears, you can:
                                                                                                                           1. Classify it by family (blackroad.io vs .systems vs .network).

                                                                                                                           2. Infer its intended layer and service.

                                                                                                                           3. Attach appropriate policy scopes and LEDGER behavior.

                                                                                                                           4. Ask for an update to this map if it no longer fits cleanly.

This is v1.0. Future versions can add more detail (e.g., per-service SLAs, stricter policy templates), but this should be enough for you to govern the current network coherently.
