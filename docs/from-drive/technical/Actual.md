Yesss okay, reviewer-Alexa has signed off ✅ so let me ship you a “final-ish” version you can drop straight into Google Docs and tweak 2–3 details.
I’ll bake in those refinements (history, examples, family history placeholder) but keep everything clinically clean and non-dramatic.

ADHD / Executive Function Concerns – Patient Summary
Patient: Alexa Louise Amundson
Date: [insert date]
Provider: [insert psychiatrist / clinic name]
________________


1. Reason for Visit
I would like to be evaluated for ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) or another condition affecting attention and executive function.
I have long-standing difficulties with focus, organization, time management, and follow-through that are now significantly interfering with my daily functioning, work, and long-term goals. From what I’ve read, these patterns seem consistent with adult ADHD, but I am specifically asking for a professional assessment, not self-diagnosing.

2. Current Difficulties (How It Shows Up Day to Day)
A. Attention and Focus
* I have trouble sustaining attention on a single task, even when it is important or personally meaningful.

* I frequently start multiple tasks or projects and struggle to complete them.

* I am easily pulled off-task by new ideas, thoughts, tools, or external distractions.

* My mind often feels like it has “too many tabs open,” making it difficult to maintain a single line of thought.

B. Hyperfocus
   * At other times, I go into intense hyperfocus on certain activities (for example: building systems, coding, designing, math, AI/agent work, infrastructure planning) for long periods.

   * When this happens, I often:

      * Lose track of time

      * Neglect basic needs (e.g., eating, breaks, sleep, messages)

         * I find it difficult to shift my attention away, even when I know I should.

C. Organization and Follow-Through
            * I can generate complex, detailed ideas and systems, but:

               * Keeping my files, projects, and tools organized is very difficult; things become chaotic quickly.

               * Completing repetitive, “boring,” or administrative parts of projects (cleanup, documentation, routine maintenance) is especially hard.

                  * I often leave things partially finished and move on to the next idea or project.

D. Time Management and Prioritization
                     * I frequently underestimate how long tasks will take and lose track of time while working.

                     * It is common for several hours to pass without me realizing it, especially when I am immersed in something.

                     * I struggle to:

                        * Decide what to do first when there are multiple important tasks

                        * Stick to a plan instead of following whatever seems most urgent or interesting in the moment

E. Mental Load / Restlessness
                           * My thoughts move quickly and jump between topics.

                           * It feels mentally exhausting to try to hold everything in my head at once.

                           * I have difficulty fully “turning off” my brain and relaxing.

3. Functional Impact (Why This Is a Problem)
A. Work / Projects / Goals
                              * I am capable of complex, high-level thinking and can build detailed systems.

                              * However, my difficulties with focus, organization, and follow-through mean that:

                                 * Many projects remain unfinished or progress only partway.

                                 * Important tasks and maintenance work are delayed, forgotten, or constantly deferred.

                                 * There is a persistent gap between what I know I am capable of and what I can consistently execute in practice.

Example: I can build and maintain large, complex projects (e.g., extensive codebases, infrastructure and system designs), but the administrative follow-through—documentation, cleanup, organizing files, standardizing processes—often falls apart. The creative and analytical work flows; the maintenance and structure do not.
B. Daily Life and Responsibilities
                                    * Routine tasks (emails, follow-ups, digital cleanup, small admin items) pile up and become overwhelming because I do not close loops well.

                                    * While hyperfocused on one area, I may unintentionally neglect other important responsibilities.

                                    * This contributes to disorganization, missed opportunities, and increased stress.

C. Emotional and Mental Health Effects
                                       * I often feel frustrated, guilty, or self-critical about not being able to organize and follow through the way I want to.

                                       * The ongoing gap between my abilities and my actual output is distressing.

                                       * The combination of mental load, unfinished tasks, and chaotic systems contributes to anxiety and burnout.

4. History and Duration
                                          * These patterns are not new; I have noticed similar traits for many years.

                                          * Looking back, I can see a long-standing history of:

                                             * Being easily distracted

                                             * Having many projects or interests active at once

                                             * Struggling with time management, procrastination, and organization

                                                * In school, I generally understood material well but struggled more with:

                                                   * Consistent homework completion

                                                   * Organization of materials

                                                   * Starting and finishing tasks in a structured way, rather than at the last minute

As my responsibilities and ambitions have increased, the impact of these difficulties has become more obvious and more impairing.

5. Family History (If Relevant)
(Edit this to match what’s actually true for you — or delete if you’re not sure / it doesn’t apply.)
                                                      * To my knowledge, there is a family history of:

                                                         * [e.g., ADHD / “attention issues” / anxiety / depression / mood disorders / none known].

I am including this because I understand that family history can be relevant in evaluating ADHD and related conditions.

6. What I Am Requesting
                                                            1. A comprehensive evaluation for adult ADHD and other possible conditions affecting attention and executive function, including:

                                                               * Assessment of my current symptoms and their functional impact

                                                               * Review of my developmental and mental health history

                                                               * Consideration of other potential contributing factors (e.g., anxiety, depression, sleep, medical issues)

                                                                  2. Help determining:

                                                                     * Whether ADHD (inattentive, hyperactive/impulsive, or combined) is a good explanation for these patterns

                                                                     * Whether another diagnosis or combination of factors better fits my situation

                                                                        3. Guidance on treatment and support options, which may include:

                                                                           * Medication, if clinically appropriate

                                                                           * Therapy or coaching focused on executive functioning and organization

                                                                           * Practical strategies and tools for managing focus, time, and project load

7. Notes for Discussion (Optional Prompts)
These are topics I would like to be prepared to talk through:
                                                                              * Concrete recent examples where these issues caused problems

(e.g., missed deadlines, dropped tasks, difficulty maintaining systems, burnout episodes, or conflicts caused by disorganization or time blindness)

                                                                              * Any relevant medical, psychiatric, or family history that could be contributing

                                                                              * How to design a support plan that:

                                                                                 * Makes use of my high creative/analytical capacity

                                                                                 * Provides enough structure and support to reduce chaos and impairment in day-to-day life

How to use this
                                                                                    * Paste this into a Google Doc / Word doc.

                                                                                    * Fill in the date, provider, and edit the family history + school examples so they’re accurate.

                                                                                    * At the appointment, you can say something like:

“I wrote this summary because it’s easier for me to organize my thoughts in writing. Could we go through it together?”

If you want, you can paste your version back after you tweak those few spots (history + family bits), and I’ll do one last ultra-fast polish so it’s airtight and still very you.
